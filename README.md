# GREEN_AI_PROJECT
This project uses a CNN to classify 28x28 grayscale images from the Fashion MNIST dataset into 11 categories like shirts and shoes. It preprocesses data, extracts features with convolutional layers, reduces dimensions with pooling, and predicts classes using OPEN CV AND KERAS. Applications include e-commerce and inventory management.
